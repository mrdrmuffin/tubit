# TuBit v1

## Design

The design for TuBit v1 is attempting to capture as much of the nuance of playing instruments like the tuba
or trumpet as I can in a digital form. I decided to go with a 2 handed setup here with one hand controlling the pitch,
volume, and whether a note is playing using a Wii Nunchuck and the other hand controlling the notes with some leftover
cherry keyboard switches I had lying around.

## Components

- Adafruit Feather M0 Express
- Adafruit Feather Music Maker
- 4 Cherry MX switches
- 1 perma proto board (for holding the nunchuck connector)
- 1 Wii Nunchuck
- 1 Wii Nunchuck connector harvested from a broken WiiMote
- Lots of wires
- 8 ohm 1W speaker
- 2500mAh LiPoly battery
- A box (I used an old Galaxy Watch box)
- Other stuff? I forget.

## Build Instructions

Unfortunately, I can't find this prototype after moving so I can't work backwards on the build instructions from what
I had.

## Changes for Next Version

Overall the main thing I would change is removing the Nunchuck. It works great for its purpose once everything is set,
but it's a lot more finnicky than regular buttons and I'm not convinced the extra nuance from the joystick is worth it.
I'll revisit the idea in the future, but for the next revision I think there's more benefit in going with a simpler
design based on hitbox style arcade controllers.
