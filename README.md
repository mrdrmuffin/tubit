# TuBit

Tuba + Bit = TuBit, a synthesizer style musical instrument that counts the notes based on binary.

The idea of this project came from my younger days playing tuba. I always enjoyed the simplicity of fingering
on the instrument. You could make very complex music with a tuba for sure, but with 3 or 4 valves you could hit every note you needed to.

When I wanted to get back into playing instruments as an adult I tried keyboard, trumpet, guitar, and others.
Nothing felt as simple as the tuba (except maybe the trumpet, but my overbite and aniexty around practicing in an
apartment made that prospect a lot harder).

So, I started brainstorming and came up with the TuBit: An open source synthesizer instrument that takes some
cues on fingering from the tuba. Instead of having to memorize the valve positions though the fingering is
based on binary so that as a beginner you can always count up from the C to get your note. Over time it will
become muscle memory, but why not start somewhere easier?

Each distinct version of TuBit will get detailed in their own folder here. These versions are the evolution 
of my thinking and design as this project progresses.
